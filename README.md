**Link to project:** Deploying Q1 2024

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB/Mongoose, Next API Routes

Trip Report is a full-stack web app designed to be the one-stop-shop for finding everything you need to know about a hike or climb. Built using Next.js, it provides users with a seamless experience to search through reports or create their own, and find the necessary beta to complete their objective. It is built using Next API Routes to create serverless RESTFUL endpoints. The frontend is crafted with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS for a cohesive and responsive design. Google OAuth handles the authentication (more options coming) while MongoDB serves as a robust database solution.


## Optimizations In Progress

- Accessibility features
- Convert client components to server components where applicable
- Add comments to reports
