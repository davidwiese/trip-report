Trip Report is a full-stack web app designed to be the one-stop-shop for finding everything you need to know about a hike or climb. Built using Next.js, it provides users with a seamless experience to search through reports or create their own, and find the necessary beta to complete their objective. It is built primarily using Next.js Server Actions. The frontend is crafted with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS for a cohesive and responsive design. Clerk handles the authentication while MongoDB serves as a robust database solution. Upstash ensures rate limiting, PostHog provides analyticsm, and Sentry manages errors.
