				<p>
					From everyone at Trip Report, thank you for using our products! We
					build them to help you do your best work. There are millions of people
					using Trip Report products every day. Because we don&apos;t know every
					one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of
					Service to help keep the ship afloat.
				</p>

				<p>
					When we say &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or
					&quot;us&quot; in this document, we are referring to{" "}
					<a className="dark:text-white" href="https://www.tripreport.co">
						Trip Report
					</a>
					.
				</p>

				<p>
					When we say &quot;You&quot; or &quot;your&quot;, we are referring to
					the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of
					our Services.
				</p>

				<p>
					We may update these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) in the
					future. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these
					terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a
					significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the
					top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify
					account holders.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
					the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or
					enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not mean
					we are waiving that right or provision.{" "}
					<strong className="dark:text-white">
						These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.
					</strong>
				</p>

				<p>
					If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account.
					That&apos;s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of
					trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by keeping an open
					door to{" "}
					<a
						className="dark:text-white"
						href="https://www.tripreport.co/contact"
					>
						your feedback
					</a>
					.
				</p>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Account Terms</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
						password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same. The
						Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from
						your failure to comply with this security obligation.
					</li>
					<li>
						You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that
						occurs under your account, including content posted by and activity
						of any users in your account.
					</li>
					<li>
						You must be a human. Accounts registered by &quot;bots&quot; or
						other automated methods are not permitted.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these
						Services on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis.
						We do not offer service-level agreements for our Services.
					</li>
					<li>
						We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your
						usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of
						the Services. Of course, we&apos;ll reach out to the account owner
						before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use
						may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other
						customers.
					</li>
					<li>
						We take many measures to protect and secure your data through
						backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for
						data transmission from the public Internet.
					</li>
					<li>
						When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take
						that trust to heart. You agree that Trip Report may process your
						data as described in our{" "}
						<a
							className="dark:text-white"
							href="https://www.tripreport.co/privacy-policy"
						>
							Privacy Policy
						</a>{" "}
						and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the
						following reasons:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong className="dark:text-white">
									To help you with support requests you make.
								</strong>{" "}
								We&apos;ll ask for express consent before accessing your
								account.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong className="dark:text-white">
									On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an
									automated process partway through.
								</strong>{" "}
								We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix
								the issue and restart automated processing without looking at
								any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a
								minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare
								cases, we aim to fix the root cause to prevent the errors from
								recurring.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong className="dark:text-white">
									To safeguard Trip Report.
								</strong>{" "}
								We&apos;ll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to
								ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If
								necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an abuse
								report investigation.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong className="dark:text-white">
									To the extent required by applicable law.
								</strong>{" "}
								As a US company with all data infrastructure located in the US,
								we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US
								government authority with a legally binding order or proper
								request under the Stored Communications Act, or in limited
								circumstances in the event of an emergency request. If a non-US
								authority approaches Trip Report for assistance, our default
								stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US
								government, which compels us to comply through procedures
								outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or
								agreement mechanism. If Trip Report is audited by a tax
								authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information
								needed to complete the audit.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
						necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
						technology required to run the Services.
					</li>
					<li>
						Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (&quot;CCPA&quot;), Trip
						Report is a &quot;service provider&quot;, not a &quot;business&quot;
						or &quot;third party&quot;, with respect to your use of the
						Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for
						the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms and
						the{" "}
						<a
							className="dark:text-white"
							href="https://www.tripreport.co/privacy-policy"
						>
							Privacy Policy
						</a>
						. We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information
						for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit
						permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your
						requirements under the CCPA and not use Trip Report&apos;s Services
						in a way that violates the regulations.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Copyright and Content Ownership</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						All content posted on the Services must comply with U.S. copyright
						law.
					</li>
					<li>
						You give us a limited license to use the content posted by you and
						your users in order to provide the Services to you, but we claim no
						ownership rights over those materials. All materials you submit to
						the Services remain yours.
					</li>
					<li>
						We do not pre-screen content, but we reserve the right (but not the
						obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content
						that is available via the Service.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Company or its licensors own all right, title, and interest in
						and to the Services, including all intellectual property rights
						therein, and you obtain no ownership rights in the Services as a
						result of your use. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any
						portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript (or any code) or
						visual design elements without express written permission from the
						Company. You must request permission to use the Company&apos;s logos
						or any Service logos for promotional purposes. Please{" "}
						<a
							className="dark:text-white"
							href="http://www.tripreport.co/contact"
						>
							contact us
						</a>{" "}
						for requests to use logos. We reserve the right to rescind any
						permissions if you violate these Terms.
					</li>
					<li>
						You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit
						any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the
						Services without the express written permission of the Company.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Features and Bugs</h2>
				<p>
					We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the
					experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However,
					there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no
					guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or
					expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As
					with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track
					the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any
					related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed
					and we don&apos;t guarantee completely error-free Services.
				</p>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Services Adaptations and API Terms</h2>
				<p>
					We offer Application Program Interfaces (&quot;API&quot;s) for some of
					our Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party
					product that accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the
					following specific terms:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
						damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party
						products that access data via the API.
					</li>
					<li>
						Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality
						is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or
						reports a Service user&apos;s activity{" "}
						<em>other than time tracking</em>, both inside and outside the
						applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if
						an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has
						built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user
						surveillance will be required to remove that integration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API
						may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your
						account&apos;s access to the API. The Company, in its sole
						discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If
						we need to suspend your account&apos;s access, we will attempt to
						warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused
						downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2 className="dark:text-white">Liability</h2>
				<p>
					We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one
					section:
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>
						<strong className="dark:text-white">
							You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be
							liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any
							direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special,
							consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not
							limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or
							other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of
							the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or
							the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of
							substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data,
							information or services purchased or obtained or messages received
							or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii)
							unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or
							data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the
							service; (v) or any other matter relating to these Terms or the
							Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including
							negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of
							liability.
						</strong>
					</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making
					a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that&apos;s on you, not us.
					We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful
					management of the business; investments in security, infrastructure,
					and talent. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting
					on us.
				</p>
